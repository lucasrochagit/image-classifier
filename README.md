# Image Classifier

This project utilizes the potential of machine learning to learn numerical patterns through drawing numbers on images to reproduce an Image Sorter. Machine learning was done through an IPython file, interpreted by a [Notebook Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), and the UI application was created using the [Flask Framework](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* [Python - Version 3.6.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/) - It can be the major version of python or a minor version.

### Installing

#### Create a Virtual environment with the python version 3.6.3 into the project path
##### Windows 
```sh
virtualenv --python=PATH_TO_PYTHON_3.6.3 venv
```
##### Linux
```sh
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.6 
```
#### Make the Virtual Environment Active
##### Windows
```sh
source venv/Scripts/activate
```
##### Linux
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### Install this packages in specific versions
```sh
pip install numpy==1.17.0 
pip install scipy==1.0.0
pip install scikit-image==0.14.2
pip install scikit-learn==0.19.1
